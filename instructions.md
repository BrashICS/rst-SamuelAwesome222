This connect four game works in all seven columns, however only the first four verticle spaces (starting from the bottom) in each column is reconized as able to be connected four in a row.
All 7 column buttons must be pressed once beforehand due to an unknown error in the code.
I think this should be spared on marks because i really tried to make it functional and clearly didnt cheat or use any tutorials and only searched for specific commands online. The vastly unefficient nature of my code is a testament to this.
Another issue is the winner is only declared once the column that has four in a row is pressed one more time after the four has been placed.
The counters in the top left are to give insight on the counter process i used in the table. Eacther number (starting from top) corresponds to a row starting from left to right.
Additionally, the O + number featured in the table also gives insight on how it all works, as i wanted to make it clear so it isnt hard to access.
